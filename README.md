Driver is based on the latest update for the German [v2.0 from July 8, 2025](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0012/4957/4961/files/Redragon_K668-RGB-DE_Setup_v2.0_20250708.exe?v=1752481290).

## Known issues

- Even though application names have been renamed for regional version, status/window name will still be K668-RGB-DE.
- Do not try to apply settings when music mode is on, turn it off first, this is a common problem with v2.0.
- In order for backlight animations to be displayed in window, they must first be applied using a separate save button.
